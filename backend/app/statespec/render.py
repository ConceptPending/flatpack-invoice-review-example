"""Turn a `StateSpec` into artifacts humans read.

These outputs are the half of the value proposition that isn't tests: a
diagram and a plain-English table that a reviewer, auditor, or domain owner
can read to confirm the workflow is *fit for purpose* — without reading
Python. `to_dict` is the same data as JSON, the seed for a future
layperson-facing viewer (a separate tool/repo).
