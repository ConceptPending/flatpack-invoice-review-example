"""The generic state-machine engine: data model, enforcement, and analysis.

Nothing in here is invoice-specific. A `StateSpec` is pure data; `apply` is
the only place a transition is ever allowed to happen; `validate` proves a
spec is well-formed before it can mislead anyone. Keep this file small and
domain-free — that is what lets one Hypothesis test (driving `apply` over
random sequences) stand in as a correctness proof for *every* spec.
